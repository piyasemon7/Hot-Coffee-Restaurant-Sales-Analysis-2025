# Hot-Coffee-Restaurant-Sales-Analysis-2025
My Solution: I created an interactive dashboard by analyzing the restaurant's data for the entire year.  Monthly Sales Trend: Through a line chart, I showed that sales were highest in January and dropped in February.  Product Performance: Through a bar chart, I identified that 'Kacchi' and 'Coffee' were the most profitable items.
